# Optional Host TTS service

Date: 2026-09-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Kepos TTS already owns provider credentials, live-session validation, cache
identity, and bounded MP3 artifacts, but those capabilities were reachable
only through the browser Connection RPC. Another Host plugin should be able to
deliver trusted speech without routing through a browser transport or copying
provider integrations.

## Decision

The Kepos plugin publishes one optional Cordis service at `keposTts` while its
Host fiber is mounted. Its stable contract is:

```ts
interface KeposTtsService {
  synthesize(
    request: { sessionId: string; text: string },
    signal?: AbortSignal
  ): Promise<{ mediaType: "audio/mpeg"; data: Uint8Array }>;
  transcribe(
    request: {
      sessionId: string;
      mediaType: string;
      data: Uint8Array;
      language?: string;
    },
    signal?: AbortSignal
  ): Promise<{
    text: string;
    sentences: Array<{
      startMs: number;
      endMs: number;
      text: string;
      language?: string;
      expression?: string;
    }>;
  }>;
}
```

The service delegates to the existing `TtsGateway`, so validation, session and
workspace resolution, provider and credential selection, deterministic cache
identity, provider invocation, and bounded artifact reads remain owned by
Kepos. It returns bytes only: consumers do not receive a browser URL or cache
path. Typed gateway failure categories remain the failure vocabulary, and no
provider diagnostic is placed in the service value.

The same optional service also exposes bounded, synchronous Qwen ASR for
short non-real-time audio. It resolves the shared DashScope credential on each
call, uses the fixed `qwen3-asr-flash` model, propagates cancellation, and
returns provider-neutral text plus ordered sentence timings. Provider-owned
confidence and raw response fields are not part of the contract.

The service is optional and is removed with the plugin lifecycle. Consumers
must read it with `ctx.get("keposTts")` and handle `undefined`; Kepos does not
inject consumers. The authenticated browser RPC and same-origin artifact route
remain unchanged for browser tagged-TTS behavior.

## Consequences

Host consumers can upload or otherwise process one bounded MP3 without knowing
about Web transport or cache layout. Host consumers can likewise submit one
bounded audio clip for Qwen recognition without knowing DashScope request
details. Deployments without Kepos TTS expose no service, while mounted
deployments retain one provider and cache owner. This is an in-process Host
seam, not a public synthesis endpoint or a streaming audio API.

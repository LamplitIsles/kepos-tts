# Kepos TTS context

This glossary describes the ownership and boundaries of Kepos TTS's browser
and Host-facing synthesis paths.

## Language

**Tagged passage**:
The one finalized assistant passage enclosed by `[[tts:text]]` and
`[[/tts:text]]`. It is validated and normalized before synthesis; the tag is
audio-only and is never a provider or voice override.

**Browser TTS path**:
The authenticated Connection RPC and same-origin audio route used by the DSH
browser. It returns a workspace-owned URL and keeps native `<audio>` playback
unchanged.

**Host TTS service**:
The optional in-process Cordis service temporarily named `keposTts`. A Host
plugin calls `synthesize({ sessionId, text }, signal?)` for bounded MP3 bytes,
or `transcribe({ sessionId, mediaType, data, language? }, signal?)` for a
short, non-real-time Qwen ASR result with audio-level language and expression
annotations. Both operations require a live session; the transcription path
uses the shared DashScope credential and returns no browser URL, filesystem
path, public HTTP route, or persisted artifact. The synchronous model does not
provide sentence timestamps. The service name remains TTS-oriented until a
future user-approved rename.

**Live session**:
A DSH session that resolves to an absolute workspace cwd through the Host
session resolver. The session supplies both authorization context and the
workspace used for cache ownership.

**Workspace audio artifact**:
The deterministic, atomically written MP3 under
`.dsh/kepos-tts/audio/<sha256>.mp3`. Browser and Host synthesis share this
artifact and its bounded read contract.

**Provider profile**:
The normalized provider, provider model/resource identity, and Voice ID used
for one request and its cache key. Credentials are resolved separately and
never enter the profile identity or returned service value.

**Shared DashScope credential**:
`KEPOS_TTS_DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`, used by Alibaba TTS and the fixed
`qwen3-asr-flash` Host transcription operation. It is configured through the
write-only native settings card regardless of the selected TTS output provider;
the Volcengine credential remains ByteDance-TTS-only.

**Speech-expression label**:
An optional discrete audio-level label returned by Qwen's model. It is
model-derived speech-expression metadata, not a factual claim about a speaker's
inner state, diagnosis, or decision signal.
